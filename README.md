100DaysOfCode Day 3! Taking a step back to Python. I haven't touched Python for months as the second half of my bootcamp focused on Node/Express/React so I wanted to start with something simple to get the syntacical juices flowing again. I found a great course by Dr. Angela Yu from Long App Brewery and wanted to just reintroduce myself to some ideas.

Todays project was supposed to be a random band name generator however I did remember some extra steps and decided to up mine to be a password generator instead. I got to brush up on print(), input(), string manipulation, variable naming, commenting/debugging/errors.

Users will be prompted answer a series of questions and the password is built based on the length of some words, uppercasing others and lowercasing the last.

This is NOT a random password generator as the user input creates insecurities however it will be MORE randomized than most people will think about when prompted to come up with a secure PW. In no way am I saying that users should rely on this method but rather just a quick project to see what I can remember for such an exercise
